# Ads Click-Through Rate (CTR) Classification

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting Click-Through Rate (CTR) for online advertisements using a classification model. The goal is to determine whether a user will click on an ad based on various features.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Model Used:** Random Forest Classifier

## Dataset
The dataset contains various features influencing ad clicks. It includes categorical and numerical variables representing user behavior, ad properties, and contextual information.

## Feature Engineering & Model Development
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Engineered new features to improve model performance.
- Used Random Forest Classifier to classify whether an ad will be clicked.
- Analyzed feature importance to understand key drivers of CTR.

## Model Performance
The Random Forest model was trained and evaluated, achieving the following performance metrics on the test dataset:

### Classification Report:

```

## Key Takeaways
- The model achieved an accuracy of **78%**, with a good balance between precision and recall.
- The **feature importance** analysis provided insights into which factors most influence ad clicks.
- Future improvements could include hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and testing other classifiers like XGBoost.

## Future Enhancements
- Experiment with additional models (XGBoost, LightGBM) to improve accuracy.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning for better generalization.
- Use more advanced feature engineering techniques.
